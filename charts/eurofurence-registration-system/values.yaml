      #
      # the mode of room management this convention employs.go_live:
      #
      # off (default) = room management features are completely disabled.
      #
      #   Completely hides all relevant pages and options, only displays a few simple
      #   messages in some places.
      #
      #   typical usecase: private party, housemeet, pay-at-the-door
      #
      # external = the venue handles all room bookings directly
      #
      #   The only feature the room service offers is an API endpoint with a countdown
      #   until revealing a secret codeword. Staff can have a different secret codeword
      #   and a different reveal time.
      #
      #   See the go_live section to configure the secret codewords.
      #
      #   The idea is that you show an info page to accepted attendees called "how to book a room".
      #
      #   Email generator standalone page: https://github.com/eurofurence/reg-hotel-booking
      #   (not maintained any more because Eurofurence does not currently need it)
      #
      # packages = sell accomodation as packages
      #
      #   Note: currently somewhat unfinished because none of the current conventions use this mode.
      #
      #   Use this when the convention is reselling individual rooms or beds
      #     - allows individual pricing of room options
      #     - attendees enter their roommate ids in their registration
      #       (currently not implemented)
      #     - rooms can be maintained in the database
      #     - packages become unavailable when their quota is exceeded
      #       (currently not implemented)
      #
      #   In this mode, you can go wild with accommodation packages.
      #
      #   typical usecase: small hotels (large hotels will often force you to use their booking provider)
      #
      # groups = attendees can form room sharing groups which are then assigned to rooms by staff
      #
      #   Use this when you want staff to have fine-grained control over room assignments
      #     - staff needs to watch that the number of accepted attendees does not exceed available beds
      #     - staff needs to enter available rooms in the registration system
      #     - staff needs to do room assignment into actual rooms prior to the convention
      #     - conventions can track keys given to the attendees during onsite check-in
      #     - individual pricing of room options is not directly supported, but with a trick you can do it anyway:
      #       simply add regular sales packages with the various room prices. If you do this, staff will need to
      #       manually ensure no-one unintentionally gets a room they haven't paid for.
      #
      #   typical usecase: youth hostels (the price of registration automatically includes a bed)
      #
      mode: 'off' # external, packages, groups
